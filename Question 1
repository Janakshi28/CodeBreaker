Question 1) 
Given five positive integers, You have to use exactly four of the five integers and calculate a value by adding two numbers together and subtracting two numbers from it.

Find the Largest value that can be calculated as mentioned above.

Input Format

A single line of five space-separated integers.

Constraints

Each integer is in the inclusive range [1,10 9 ].

Output Format

Print a single long integer denoting the largest value that can be calculated as mentioned above (The output can be greater than a 32 bit integer.)

Sample Input 0

1 5 3 2 4
Sample Output 0

6
Explanation 0

We add 5 and 4 together and substrate 1 and 2 from it. Then we have 6 that is the maximum value that can be calculated by adding two integers together and subtracting another two integers from it.
