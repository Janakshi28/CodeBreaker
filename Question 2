Q 2) 
To enter the code breaker competition you will have to decrypt a set of words we have already encrypted using the following encryption algorithm.

When a plaintext and a key N is provided, each letter of the plaintext will be incremented sequentially till N letters and the incrementing sequence will repeat again.

For an example consider the word:DOTITUDE and the key (N)=3
Then the encrypted text would be:EQWJVXEG

As the key given is 3, letter D is incremented by 1, O is incremented by 2, T is incremented by 3 and again I is incremented by 1 , T is incremented by 2 and so on.

Your task is to decrypt the encrypted words we will be providing.

Input Format

First line will consist the encrypted word
The second line will be the Key (N)

Constraints

0 < N < 27
Encrypted word only consist with uppercase and lowercase characters

Output Format

Decrypted word (Plaintext)
