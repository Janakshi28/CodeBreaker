The USS Nimitz is a Nimitz class aircraft carrier currently anchored at an unknown location in the Mediterranean sea. The ship has around 50 F18A/E Super Hornets in its bays. Assume that each fighter jet has the fuel capacity to fly exactly half way across the world in a large circle. The F18A/E Super Hornet is a very advanced jet and has the ability to refuel inflight without losing speed or spilling jet fuel. The USS Nimitz has an unlimited stock of jet fuel and is the only source of fuel for these jets. What is the fewest number of aircraft necessary to get 1 jet across the world keeping in mind that all of the jets must return back to the ship safely?

Your task is to write a code to generate your answer. We will be evaluating your code manually therefore if you are unable to code the answer please explain your approach as a comment and submit.

**If you are unable to code the answer explain the approach you have used as follow:
       If you select the language as python:

    ‘’’This is the approach i used (Write your approach here)’’’
Additional Information:

Ignore extra fuel consumption as a result of acceleration, evaporation of fuel.
Since we need to have all jets return safely to the ship, you cannot give all fuel away to the other jet.
Refueling is an extremely fast process.
